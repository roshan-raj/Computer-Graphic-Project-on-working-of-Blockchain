Demonstration of Blockchain using Graphic System. 

### Installation Instruction (Ubuntu/Linux)

- The first step is to install the development libraries of OpenGL/Glut in Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev
```
- Clone the repository and 'cd' over to [the main directory](https://github.com/roshan139154/Computer-Graphic-Project-on-working-of-Blockchain), execute the following command

```
$ gcc main.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut -lm -o output
$ ./output
```
### Instruction for CodeBlocks

- If you have CodeBlocks installed just open the project in it and run the main.cpp file. Make sure you have freeglut setup in your codeblocks.

### Instruction for Visual Studio

- If you have Visual Studio installed, create a new project and copy the contents of the [main.cpp](https://github.com/roshan139154/Computer-Graphic-Project-on-working-of-Blockchain/blob/master/main.cpp), to your file and run it. If you haven't setup Visual Studio with OpenGl you can follow this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HurTyJ3v_xg) and do so.
